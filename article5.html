   Bukayo Saka scored two goals as Arsenal beat Liverpool 3-2 at the Emirates on Sunday, returning Mikel Arteta's side to the top of the Premier League table above Manchester City. An absolutely thrilling match started with a bang, as Gabriel Martinelli fired the hosts into the lead just 58 seconds in. His goal was the quickest Arsenal have scored in a league match at the Emirates since October 2011. The goal also marked the tenth time the Reds had conceded first in their past 12 league matches. Liverpool thought they may have earned a penalty after Diogo Jota's cross hit Gabriel Magalhaes' hand in the box, but no call was forthcoming. The Premier League confirmed to The Athletic that the penalty was not awarded due to Gabriel’s proximity to the ball, with the Arsenal defender deemed to have no time to react to Jota’s pass. Liverpool would not trail for much longer, as Darwin Nunez equalised in the 34th minute. Gabriel was guilty of misplaying a clearance in the buildup. Arsenal took their second lead of the day just seconds before half-time, as Saka tapped-in at the far post after Martinelli led a quick counter-attack. Gabriel's dummy for Saka made up for the defender's earlier mistake. Liverpool responded well early in the second half, controlling play and levelling the score again, this time through Roberto Firmino in the 53rd minute. Arsenal would not be denied on this day though, as they pressed on and eventually won a penalty as Michael Oliver ruled Gabriel Jesus was fouled in the box. Saka coolly converted from the spot in the 76th minute for his second goal and Arsenal's third lead of the match. This was just Arsenal's second win over Liverpool in their last 15 Premier League meetings. Jurgen Klopp's men have failed to win any of their first four away league matches of the season for the first time since 2010.
