    The series will follow Arsenal's battle to finish as high as possible in the Premier League in a bid to qualify for next year's European competitions. Following the departure of Unai Emery, Mikel Arteta has been in charge of the team for two years. The 2021/22 campaign is seen as a crucial one for the Spaniard, as he tries to improve the famous club's fortunes.After some terrible early results, Arsenal sat bottom of the Premier League in August, so the opening episodes aren't expected to be pleasant viewing for fans of the Gunners, although the team's form has picked up since then. There are sure to be plenty of twists and turns before May, but will the season end successfully? Much of the focus will be on manager, Mikel Arteta, with club captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang - who has often had a turbulent relationship with his coach - also expected to  feature heavily. Yet young English players, Emile Smith-Rowe, Bukayo Saka and Aaron Ramsdale, could be the stars of the show. 
    “We are looking forward to giving our fans around the world a unique insight into how we work day to day," says Mark Gonnella, Arsenal’s Media and Communications Director. “We have one of the biggest global followings in the game and one consistent thing we hear from fans is their desire to see more about what happens behind closed doors at the club. All or Nothing will give our fans and sport lovers an opportunity to learn more about what makes Arsenal such a special club, our trophy laden history and our ambitions for future success.”. “Arsenal is a historic club going through a fascinating period, and we can’t wait to take viewers behind-the-scenes on the journey of this crucial season,” said Dan Grabiner, Head of UK Originals, Amazon Studios. “All or Nothing is about intimate access to the passion and commitment behind elite sport, and in Arsenal we have the perfect subject for the next chapter. We are looking forward to Prime members around the world experiencing another Premier League season with a new club, through All or Nothing’s signature quality storytelling and access.”
