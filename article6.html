    Arsenal have ensured that they'll spend yet another weekend atop the Premier League after an emphatic 3-1 win over Tottenham in the North London derby. A stunner from outside the box by Thomas Partey was canceled out by a Harry Kane goal for an even first half but Arsenal pulled away in the second period scoring either side of a red card shown by referee Anthony Taylor to Spurs defender Emerson Royal. Mistakes are punished in derby matches, and Saturday it was Spurs who let the occasion get to them. A howler from Hugo Lloris gifted Gabriel Jesus a goal in the 49th minute and Arsenal wouldn't look back from there. It was a physical match with both teams walking the of unfair play and generally getting away with it until Emerson Royal's challenge on Gabriel Martinelli ended up getting him sent off. It was a rash tactical foul, with Emerson going in quite high, the kind of prototypical "orange card" offense that sometimes ends in a red but often leads to a yellow card. Today, however, Taylor's rope had run out. It's always up to the player to avoid giving a referee a decision to make in these scenarios, and Arsenal showed Spurs why it's so critical not to make dumb mistakes. It would only take four minutes for Arsenal to make Tottenham pay. A resurgent Granit Xhaka got onto the end of a cross from Martinelli to put the Gunners up by two, forcing Antonio Conte into a quadruple sub to save players like Heung-Min Son and Richarlison for midweek fixtures. After defeating Leicester City 6-2 before the international break, the hope was that Tottenham would bring momentum through the time off and into this headline match, but it wasn't to be as their struggles at the Emirates will continue. Spurs haven't won at Arsenal's home since November of 2010 and that wait will continue while the Gunners move closer to establishing themselves as title contenders.
